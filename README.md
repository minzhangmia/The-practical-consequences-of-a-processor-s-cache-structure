write a C program to compute a vector triad, for vectors of doubles, of lengths 10 to 10 . Print the data to a file, and create a plot that shows the change in performance as the vector length increases; this should be a plot of performance in GFLOPS (Y axis) vs vector length (X axis), and you will want to use a log scale for the vector length.
